Plenty of outdoor walking, good air, drinking plenty of water and eating proper foods, avoiding foods that are overheating, especially the starches and raw or rare meats—this will yield results.

In other words, during this period a person may have temporary trouble with the stomach, bowels, bloodstream, and nerves. These conditions seem to come quickly, last but a few days, and pass away quickly. None of these should be neglected; each should be given immediate attention, but there need be no anxiety regarding the continuance of such conditions if immediate attention is given, for all of the influences tend to bring rapid changes in the health and physical condition of the body during these 52 days. During this period there are apt to be days with headaches, upset stomachs, trouble with the eyes or the ears, catarrh, coughs, aches and pains through mild forms of cold, and with women occasionally aches and pains in the breasts and abdomen. During this period everyone should try to be cheerful and not permit the mind to dwell upon the temporary conditions that affect the body, but simply attend promptly to the checking of any condition that may arise and then cast it out of the mind.",

Persons should be careful of their food and not overeat, and the body should be kept normally warm because during this period there will be a tendency toward colds, often resulting from overeating or overheating the body. The bloodstream should be kept clean and the bowels active, so that blood conditions will not result in sores, boils, eczema, rashes, or other more serious conditions of the skin and blood. The blood pressure also should be watched during this period, for there will be a tendency for it to rise, and overwork or strain should be avoided.

More sleep and more rest are required during this period than in any other part of the year. Fretfulness and nervousness may also affect the digestion, the functioning of the stomach, and may also produce a nervous heart which may cause misgivings and inconvenience.

All of this must be avoided during this period in order to prevent serious conditions. This is a good period in which to recover from fevers, chronic conditions, or other abnormal or subnormal conditions of the body which have been existing for some time.

Everyone should be especially careful of catching colds or contracting serious contagious fevers during this period by avoiding the places where such things may be contacted. The mind and whole nature is very apt to be despondent and below normal in the ability to ward off and fight an incoming condition. Even the bloodstream may be lowered in its vitality at this period and, therefore, is unable to fight even the normal amount of germs or unfavorable influences that generally come in contact with every human being. It is not a good time, however, for taking medicine or having an operation performed, or for starting any new or drastic method of improving the health unless in an emergency or unless it is to be continued over a long period, so that its real effect will come into the next period of 52 days, which will be Period No. 1 of the next cycle. The eyes, the ears, and in fact any one of the five senses may become affected during this period, and care should be taken that colds or other conditions do not linger during this period or continue without proper expert attention.
